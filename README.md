## Overview
The **Fin-Fan Cooler** is an industrial heat exchanger system designed to dissipate heat from process fluids using air-cooled finned tubes. It is widely used in power plants, petrochemical industries, and process industries where water cooling is limited or unavailable.

Key features include:
- Efficient heat transfer through finned tube design.
- Air-cooled system requiring minimal water consumption.
- Modular construction for easy maintenance and scalability.

## Features
- Natural or forced convection airflow options.
- Low maintenance with robust design.
- High thermal efficiency and energy savings.
- Designed for high-temperature and high-pressure applications.

## Installation
1. Unpack the components and verify against the packing list.
2. Install the cooler on a solid foundation with proper alignment.
3. Connect inlet and outlet piping according to process requirements.
4. Ensure all fans and electrical connections are installed following safety standards.
5. Test the system under controlled conditions before full operation.

## Usage
```bash
# Example command to simulate cooler operation
python run_cooler_simulation.py --inlet-temp 150 --flow-rate 5000
